## BACKGROUND

1.1. This Safety Requirements publication establishes requirements for establishing, assessing, sustaining and continuously improving effective leadership  and  management  for  safety  in  organizations  concerned  with,  and facilities  and  activities  that  give  rise  to,  radiation 1 risks.  This  includes  the regulatory body and other competent authorities, and the organization responsible for the facility or for the activity.

1.2. This Safety Requirements publication supersedes IAEA Safety Standards Series  No.  GS-R-3  on  the  Management  System  for  Facilities  and Activities 2 . This Safety Requirements publication develops the concepts of the publication of  2006  and  takes  into  account  lessons  drawn  from  experience  in  events  that have occurred. It emphasizes that leadership for safety, management for safety, an  integrated  management  system  and  a  systemic  approach  (i.e.  an  approach relating  to  the  system  as  a  whole  in  which  the  interactions  between  technical, human  and  organizational  factors  are  duly  considered)  are  essential  to  the specification and application of adequate safety measures and the fostering of a strong safety culture [1].

1.3. Management systems that are designed to fulfil  the  requirements  of  this Safety  Requirements  publication  will  integrate  safety,  health,  environmental, security, quality, human-and-organizational-factor, societal and economic elements 3 . The management system supports the achievement of the fundamental safety objective of protecting people and the environment from harmful effects of ionizing radiation [1], and takes into account the interfaces between safety and security. Experience from Member States in developing, applying, sustaining and improving management systems was taken into account in the development of this safety standard.

1 'Radiation' as used here means ionizing radiation.

2 INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC  ENERGY AGENCY,  The  Management  System  for Facilities and Activities, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. GS-R-3, IAEA, Vienna (2006).

3 Economic objectives are included in the list of elements that have to be integrated, as  it  is  recognized  that  economic  decisions  and  actions  may  introduce,  or  may  mitigate, potential risks.

## 1.  INTRODUCTION

1.4. Effective  application  of  the  requirements  of  this  Safety  Requirements publication will satisfy the fundamental safety principles [1], and in particular Principle 3, which states that 'Effective leadership and management for safety must be established and sustained in organizations concerned with, and facilities and activities that give rise to, radiation risks.'

1.5. This Safety Requirements publication establishes requirements for ensuring safety on the basis of the interrelated concepts of:

- (a) Leadership 4 for  safety:  by  establishing  and  integrating  the  organization's vision,  goals,  strategies,  plans  and  objectives;  by  advocating  individual commitment to the protection of people and the environment from harmful effects  of  ionizing  radiation;  and  by  advocating  the  fundamental  safety principles [1], establishing behavioural expectations and fostering a strong safety culture [2].
- (b) Management  for  safety: this includes establishing and applying an effective  management  system.  This  management  system  has  to  integrate all elements of management so that requirements for safety are established and applied coherently with other requirements, including those for human performance, quality and security; and so that safety is not compromised by the need to meet other requirements or demands. Safety measures and security measures must be designed and applied in an integrated manner [1]. The management system also has to ensure the fostering of a strong safety culture, the regular assessment of safety performance and the application of  lessons  from  experience.  The  management  system  also  supports  the development of proactive and responsive management.

1.6. Principle  1  of  Fundamental  Safety  Principles  [1]  states  that  'The  prime responsibility  for  safety  must  rest  with  the  person  or  organization  responsible for  facilities  and  activities  that  give  rise  to  radiation  risks.'  Leadership  and management for safety are therefore of fundamental importance for organizations that  are  responsible  for  facilities  and  activities  that  give  rise  to  radiation  risks and that therefore have the prime responsibility for the safety of such facilities and activities.

4 'Leadership' is the use of an individual's capabilities and competences to give direction to  individuals  and  groups  and  to  influence  their  commitment  to  achieving  the  fundamental safety objective and to applying the fundamental safety principles, by means of shared goals, values  and  behaviour.  'Management'  is  a  formal,  authorized  function  for  ensuring  that  an organization operates efficiently and that work is completed in accordance with requirements, plans and resources. Managers at all levels need to be leaders for safety.

1.7. The requirements established in this Safety Requirements publication are intended for use in the following ways:

- (a) By the registrant or licensee, for establishing and sustaining leadership and management  on  the  part  of  organizations  and  managers  responsible  for facilities and activities 5 that give rise to radiation risks 6 [1-3];
- (b) By the registrant or licensee, to specify to a vendor or supplier of products and  equipment,  or  a  contractor  for  services,  and  to  any  other  relevant organization,  any  requirements  that  must  be  met  by  the  vendor's  or supplier's management system;
- (c) By the regulatory body, as part of the basis for the regulation of facilities and activities;
- (d) By  the  regulatory  body  and  other  relevant  governmental  organizations, as  a  basis  for  meeting  their  responsibilities  for  arrangements 7 in  relation to  leadership  and  management,  in  conjunction  with  the  requirements established in Ref. [4].

1.8. The  requirements  established  in  this  Safety  Requirements  publication apply to all types of facilities and activities, as specified in para. 1.11. However,

5 'Facilities' includes: nuclear facilities; irradiation installations; some mining and raw material processing facilities such as uranium mines; radioactive waste management facilities; and any other places where radioactive material is produced, processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of - or where radiation generators are installed - on such a scale that consideration of protection and safety is required. 'Activities' includes: the production, use, import and export of radiation sources for industrial, research and medical purposes; the transport of radioactive material; the decommissioning of facilities; radioactive waste management activities such as the discharge of effluents; and some aspects of the remediation of sites affected by residues from past activities.

6 The term 'radiation risks' is defined as:

-  Detrimental  health  effects  of  exposure  to  radiation  (including  the  likelihood  of such effects occurring);

-  Any other safety related risks (including those to the environment) that might arise as a direct consequence of:

● Exposure to radiation;

● The presence of radioactive material (including radioactive waste) or its release to the environment;

- A loss of control over a nuclear reactor core, nuclear chain reaction, radioactive source or any other source of radiation.

7 'Arrangements'  in  this  context  means  an  integrated  set  of  infrastructural  elements necessary to provide the capability for performing a specified function or task. Such elements may  include  authorities  and  responsibilities,  organization,  coordination,  personnel,  plans, procedures, facilities, equipment, training and contracts.

the  way  in  which  the  requirements  are  to  be  met  will  vary  depending  on  the safety significance and complexity of the facility or activity. Recommendations and  guidance  on  meeting  the  requirements  are  provided  in  Safety  Guides. Other international standards or national standards 8 may be used in addition to the requirements of this Safety Requirements publication.

## OBJECTIVE

1.9. The  objective  of  this  Safety  Requirements  publication  is  to  establish requirements that support Principle 3 of Fundamental Safety Principles [1], in relation  to  establishing,  sustaining  and  continuously  improving  leadership  and management for safety, and an effective management system. This is essential in order to foster and sustain a strong safety culture in an organization. Another objective  is  to  establish  requirements  that  apply  Principle  8,  which  states that  'All  practical  efforts  must  be  made  to  prevent  and  mitigate  nuclear  or radiation accidents.'

## SCOPE

1.10. 'Safety'  encompasses  the  protection  of  people  and  the  environment against radiation risks and the safety of facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks.

1.11. The requirements in this Safety Requirements publication apply to types of facilities and activities that give rise to radiation risks, as follows:

- (a) Nuclear  installations  (including  nuclear  power  plants;  research  reactors (including subcritical and critical assemblies) and any adjoining radioisotope production facilities; facilities for the storage of spent nuclear fuel;  facilities  for  the  enrichment  of  uranium;  nuclear  fuel  fabrication facilities;  conversion  facilities;  facilities  for  the  reprocessing  of  spent nuclear fuel; facilities for the predisposal management of radioactive waste arising  from  nuclear  fuel  cycle  facilities;  and  nuclear  fuel  cycle  related research and development facilities) [5, 6];

8 International standards are, for example, those of the International Organization for Standardization or the European Foundation for Quality Management; national standards are, for example, British standards on Occupational Health and Safety Management or the Nuclear Quality Assurance standards of the United States of America.

- (b) Facilities for the mining or processing of uranium ores or thorium ores;
- (c) Irradiation installations;
- (d) Facilities and  activities for the  management  (including  disposal)  of radioactive waste, such as the discharge of effluents, and the remediation of sites affected by residual radioactive material from past activities [7];
- (e) Any  other  places  where  radioactive  material  is  produced,  processed, used, handled, stored or disposed of on such a scale that consideration of protection and safety is required, or where a radiation generator is installed;
- (f) Activities involving the production, use, or import and export of sources of ionizing radiation for medical, industrial, agricultural, educational and research purposes;
- (g) The transport of radioactive material [8];
- (h) The decommissioning (or closure) of facilities [9];
- (i) Activities involving the design and manufacture of equipment and other  works  for  and  services  to  facilities  or  activities  that  give  rise  to radiation risks [10];
- (j) Industrial activities involving naturally occurring radioactive material that are, or that may be, subject to the requirements for protection and safety.

1.12. The  requirements  in  this  Safety  Requirements  publication  also  apply in  relation  to  the  functions  and  activities  of  the  regulatory  body,  as  far  as is  appropriate.  Regulatory  bodies  and  other  government  organizations  may need  to  adapt  the  requirements  in  accordance  with  their  own  organizations' accountabilities [4].

1.13. This Safety Requirements publication applies to registrants and licensees throughout  the  lifetime  of  facilities  and  the  duration  of  activities,  for  all operational states and for accident conditions, and in a nuclear or radiological emergency.  The  lifetime  of  a  facility  includes  its  siting  and  site  evaluation, design, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning (or closure and  the  post-closure  period,  including  any  subsequent  period  of  institutional control), until its release from regulatory control.

1.14. This  Safety  Requirements  publication  does  not  specify  all  those  specific health, environment, security, quality and economic requirements to be addressed that have been established elsewhere (in other IAEA safety standards and in other international codes and standards).

## STRUCTURE

1.15. This  Safety  Requirements  publication  comprises  six  sections.  Section  2 establishes requirements for the responsibility for safety and for protecting people and the environment against radiation risks as an overriding priority. Section 3 establishes requirements for leadership for safety. Section 4 establishes requirements for management for safety. Section 5 establishes requirements on the organization to foster and support a culture for safety. Section 6 establishes requirements for measurement, assessment and improvement.
